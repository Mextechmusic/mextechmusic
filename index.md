**Kwame Obolo (Singer, US)**


I got to Mark at the time I needed a music producer. As an emerging chorale music composer, it was necessary to have a producer who really understands this genre of music and could bring life into them. Interestingly after getting to know Mark, I realised he's not only a master in Chorale music but he's all round producer. Listening to some of the other genres of his produced music really confirmed my thoughts about him of naturally being talented in music production. Though he has not been in the business for long, he is already producing music of the likes of the master music producers. His in-depth knowledge and high skill in playing the keyboard has equipped him with much understanding of chorale music hence producing super quality music. I am forever grateful that I met him and recommend him to you as well. Experience this guy, then you would understand me.

_‚ÄúPersonally I love mextech music‚Äù_  

**Bari mark fordjour( Singer, Trumpeter)**  




_‚ÄúSnr Mark (the sound engineer) is always very professional. Treated me with respect and I am sure other clients as well due to the testimonials coming from other musicians who have had the chance to work with him like myself. He always listens patiently, offers great suggestions, and gives me back a high quality demo to listen to, and if there's any need for any necessary corrections or re-recordings, he tells you to hit the studio ASAP to resolve it. He always considers the interest of his clients to his. One thing he dislikes is a breach of contract terms. Very happy working with Mextech music. They are the best so far! Now am a great "ambassador" of theirs. ‚Äù_  

**J. Michael( Singer, Rapper)**
