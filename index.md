**Bari mark fordjour( Singer, Trumpeter)**  

_‚ÄúSnr Mark (the sound engineer) is always very professional. Treated me with respect and I am sure other clients as well due to the testimonials coming from other musicians who have had the chance to work with him like myself. He always listens patiently, offers great suggestions, and gives me back a high quality demo to listen to, and if there's any need for any necessary corrections or re-recordings, he tells you to hit the studio ASAP to resolve it. He always considers the interest of his clients to his. One thing he dislikes is a breach of contract terms. Very happy working with Mextech music. They are the best so far! Now am a great "ambassador" of theirs. ‚Äù_
